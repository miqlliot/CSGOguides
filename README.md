# Introduction

For many years content creators have shared guide after guide on how to improve at CSGO. However, few of these guides are exhaustive and most focus on teaching specific tricks within an area rather than teaching for *understanding* the area itself. The result are players excelling at a specific skill such as *aiming*, while failing miserably at other skills such as *gamesense*. Since the players do not understand the parts that constitute a CSGO-player's skillset and how to improve at them, the players might continue to try and perfect their aim only to be frustrated when no improvement is seen as diminishing returns have already been reached.

The aim of this guide is to provide a stable source of exhaustive, in-depth, well-researched information aimed at teaching for understanding each part of a CSGO-player's skillset. Think of this guide as providing you with knowledge that will serve as the foundation from which you will build your glory. 

Due to the nature of the guide, the reader should not expect to be taught specific information such as how to throw a smoke grenade to block of an entrance or similar, rather, the reader should expect to gain a deep understanding of how each part of their skillset function in the context of their mind and their body. 

## Methodology

### Breakdowns

The overall guide will be written in the structure of *breakdowns*. Just as the physicist breaks down molecules into atoms, atoms into particles, and particles into quarks; Just so will this guide break down the many areas a player must consider when wanting to improve their game. The breakdowns will follow the *MECE* principle; when breaking down an area the parts will be *mutually exclusive*, i.e. not overlap, and they will be *collectively exhaustive*, i.e. not neglect an important part of the area. As an example, consider the breakdown below which creates the top-level structure that you will find in the table of contents on the left. 

![](images/breakdown_upper.png?raw=true "Initial breakdown and structure of guide")

Where each of the two boxes contain many more subboxes, which again contain subboxes of their own. This you will discover as you start exploring the site.

A player can only improve his/her game by making changes in how he/she behaves either inside of it (direct impact), or outside of it (indirect impact). Strict *MECE'ness* is an ideal to strive for, however, it is not always optimal to follow it to the letter, and the reader might notice that in some places, breakdowns will not be entirely *MECE*. 

After the breakdown, the guide will seek to explain each area as scientifically as possible, seeking to learn and understand how it works to enlighten and educate. Many areas of the scientific world will be visited, and it is the hope of the author that the reader will not only grow in respect to his/her ingame performance, but that curiousity will be sparked and the reader will be motivated to seek out his/her own answers, and discover new exciting insights that can be shared with the community. 

Should the reader notice some issues with the logic, have suggestions for additional topics or in any way want to contact the author, please use the link found below and issue a ticket.

### Impacts

Undoubtly some areas have a greater impact than others on the skill of the player, as such, each area will be labeled clearly whether the author believes it to be one of: 

Low impact
{: .label .label-green }

Medium impact
{: .label .label-yellow }

High impact
{: .label .label-red}

Note that the labels are rather general, and it is up to each individual to consider how important a certain area is for him-/herself. *Aim* for instance is undoubtly an area of *High Impact* as good aim can drastically improve ones performance. However, for a player that have already spent significant amounts of aim practice, perhabs this area is in reality *Low Impact* for that individual. 

### Litterature study

To increase transparency of the areas in this guide, each will contain a somewhat extensive litterature study by the end of the chapter. The litterature study will look at what existing information is present within the area discussed, and provide a brief description of the key-takeaways from the video/article together with a couple of comments by the author. The litterature marks the research that has been done initially by the author, but has been placed by the end as to not disrupt the purpose of the guide.

In general, the words written here will be based on five main fountains of knowledge:

1. The author's experience from 15 years of gaming, and for some years at a decent level too! 
2. The author's background from working in the Industry and from many years at University
3. Peer-reviewed scientific articles when available
4. Books when available
5. Content from CSGO content creators, professional players, analysts, organizations etc. 

### Improvements

Although the main purpose of this guide is to *Teach for Understanding* such that the player him or herself can come up with ways of improving, the guide would not be completed without some serious and well-researched suggestions. As such, after a solid knowledge base have been established for each area, suggestions for how to improve within those areas will be discussed. However, additional ideas from the community is most welcome and can likewise be reported using the link from before:
