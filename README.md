# Introduction

For many years content creators have shared guide after guide on how to improve on CSGO. However, few of these guides are exhaustive and most focus on teaching specific skills within an area rather than teaching for understanding the area itself. The result are players excelling at a specific skill such as *aiming*, while failing miserably at other skills such as *gamesense*. Since the players do not understand the general areas of a CSGO-player's skillset and how to improve each part of it, the players might continue to try and perfect their aim only to be frustrated when no improvement is seen as diminishing returns have already been reached.
