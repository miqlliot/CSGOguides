# Introduction

For many years content creators have shared guide after guide on how to improve at CSGO. However, few of these guides are exhaustive and most focus on teaching specific skills within an area rather than teaching for understanding the area itself. The result are players excelling at a specific skill such as *aiming*, while failing miserably at other skills such as *gamesense*. Since the players do not understand the parts that constitute a CSGO-player's skillset and how to improve at them, the players might continue to try and perfect their aim only to be frustrated when no improvement is seen as diminishing returns have already been reached.

The aim of this guide is to provide a stable source of exhaustive, in-depth, well-researched information aimed at teaching for understanding each part of a CSGO-player's skillset. 
As a result, the reader should not expect to be taught specific information such as how to throw a smoke grenade to block of an entrance or similar, rather, the reader should expect to gain a deep understanding on how each part of their skillset function in the context of their mind and their body. 

## Methodology

The overall guide will be written in the structure of *breakdowns*. Just as the physicist breaks down molecules into atoms, atoms into particles, and particles into quarks; Just so will this guide breakdown the many areas a player most consider when wanting to improve their game. The breakdowns will follow the *MECE* standard; when breaking down an area the parts will be *mutually exclusive*, i.e. not overlap, and they will be *collectively exhaustive*, i.e. not forget an important part of the area. As an example, consider the top-level breakdown below which creates the top-level structure that you will find in the table of contents on the left.

A player can only improve her game by making changes in how she behaves either inside of it (direct impact), or outside of it (indirect impact). Strict *MECE'ness* is an ideal to strive for, however, it is not always ideal to follow the standard to the letter, and the reader might notice that some places breakdowns will not be entirely *MECE* in order to improve readability. Should the reader notice some issues with the logic, have suggestions for additional topics or in any way want to contact the author, please use the link found below.
